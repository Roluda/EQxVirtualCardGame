      By
      value creating, you invest in the country by

      1) increasing the component
      on your card and thereby your chance of winning and

      2) bet on your card
      winning: you put more coins on the table; you can lose more.'

      By value extracting, you
      are extracting from the country by

      1) decreasing the component on your
      card and thereby your chance of winning and

      2) betting less on your
      card winning: you take away on coin from your predetermined blind.'
