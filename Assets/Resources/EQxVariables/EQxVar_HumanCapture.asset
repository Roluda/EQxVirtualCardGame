  description: "Human Capture attempts to measure the power of labor and civil service
    coalitions, including their privileges in the political system. This might be
    reflected by their ability to influence their own wages and working conditions.
    In this Pillar, evidence of their Political Power is measured by Unionization
    rates (UNI, i.3), or Public sector employees as % of total employment (PSE, i.3).
    Other areas of human capture are operationalized by the Women, Business and the
    Law (WBL, i.3) Indicator, or the extreme phenomena of modern slavery by the Global
    Slavery Index (GSI, i.3).\u200B"
