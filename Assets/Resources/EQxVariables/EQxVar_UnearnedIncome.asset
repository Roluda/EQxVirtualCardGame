  description: "Unearned Income mainly focuses on the exploitation or Value Extraction
    of natural and various resources, including the future. For instance, environmental
    footprints are conceptualized as wealth provided by nature \u2013 i.e. wealth
    that is not earned in full. In addition, low Environmental Performance Index
    (EPI, iii.9) represents intergenerational wealth transfers, as does Government
    debt as % of GDP (DBT, iii.9). State ownership, control and involvement in business
    (SOE, iii.9) is another Indicator here \u2013 the license to operate is self
    \u2013 issued rather than earned."
