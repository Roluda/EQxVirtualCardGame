  description: "Labor Rent seeks to determine all rents arising from interventions
    in or related to labor markets by participants on both supply and demand sides.
    For this purpose, the Pillar will include the Unemployment rate (UEM, iv.12)
    and other measures which often are the result of intra-labor rent seeking. Value
    Extraction phenomena in which rent seeking can a priori occur on either the employers
    or employee side are also measured, like the Delta real wage vs labor productivity
    (WLP, iv.12). More clear-cut Value Extraction models considered are the Gender
    wage gap (GWG, iv.12) and the planned Cost of Thriving Index (CTI, iv.12).\u200B"
