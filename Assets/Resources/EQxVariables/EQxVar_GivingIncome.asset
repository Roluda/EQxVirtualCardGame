  description: "Giving Income focuses on how the government uses and manages public
    finances. Redistribution of state income in the form of Subsidies and transfers
    as % of expenses (SNT, iii.7) is an important Indicator of this Pillar; many
    of these processes often divert resources away from most efficient uses and create
    hidden cost 4. The Pillar also evaluates Indicators conducive to Value Creation,
    like public education provision or health including Covid-19 safety (COV, iii.7),
    that increase competition in many markets and act to curb rent seeking behaviors.\u200B"
