  description: "Firm Dominance measures the degree of power concentration in the
    hands of a nation\u2019s leading firms. To that effect, the Pillar examines,
    for instance, the Top 10 firms market capitalization as % of GDP (FKG, ii.5),
    as well as the number of Small and medium \u2013 sized enterprises per 1,000
    people (SME, ii.5). Indicators further considered will be measurements of policies
    designed to maintain healthy levels of competition and limits to Economic Power."
