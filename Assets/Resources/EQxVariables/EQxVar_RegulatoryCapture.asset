  description: "Regulatory Capture measures the extent to which rules and regulation,
    or the making thereof, have been captured by special interests. The Pillar includes
    Administrative decentralization (AED, i.2) and Crony capitalism (CRO, i.2), derived
    from an index proposed by The Economist1, which measures wealth derived by billionaires
    from rent-heavy industries as a signal of the successful capture of regulators
    or legislators. It also incorporates the World Bank\u2019s widely-recognized
    Ease of Doing Business Index which measures the quality of a country\u2019s institutions
    and regulatory environment.\u200B"
