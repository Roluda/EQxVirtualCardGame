  description: "Producer Rent identifies rents extracted by producers and suppliers
    in the market for goods and services. Rents are extracted, for example, through
    barriers as implied in Trade Freedom (TRF, iv.10), Barriers to entry (BTE, iv.10)
    or Foreign direct investment as % of GDP (FDI, iv.10). Protectionist measures
    against entry enable Value transferring business models to be established, usually
    to the benefit of domestic producers and investors, inducing welfare losses well-documented
    in economics.\u200B"
